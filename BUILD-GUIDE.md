# Factoid Overlay - Build Guide & Distribution

## Successfully Built Executables

Your Factoid Overlay application has been successfully built into Windows executables! You now have multiple distribution options:

### üì¶ Available Distribution Files

1. **Portable Executable** (Recommended for personal use)
   - File: `Factoid Overlay-1.0.0-portable.exe` (70 MB)
   - No installation required - just run the .exe
   - Perfect for personal use and testing
   - Won't trigger most antivirus warnings

2. **ZIP Package** (Best for sharing)
   - File: `Factoid-Overlay-1.0.0-win-x64.zip` (109 MB)
   - Extract and run `Factoid Overlay.exe` from the folder
   - Easy to share with others
   - Contains all necessary files

3. **Unpacked Directory**
   - Folder: `win-unpacked/`
   - Run `Factoid Overlay.exe` directly from folder
   - Good for development and testing

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### For Personal Use
- Use the **portable executable** (`Factoid Overlay-1.0.0-portable.exe`)
- Simply download and run - no installation needed
- May get flagged by Windows Defender initially (normal for unsigned executables)

### For Public Distribution
- Share the **ZIP package** (`Factoid-Overlay-1.0.0-win-x64.zip`)
- Users extract and run the executable
- Include installation instructions

### To Reduce Antivirus False Positives

1. **Code Signing** (Professional approach)
   - Purchase a code signing certificate (~$100-400/year)
   - Sign the executable to verify authenticity
   - Significantly reduces antivirus warnings

2. **VirusTotal Submission**
   - Upload your executable to VirusTotal.com
   - This helps antivirus engines learn it's legitimate software

3. **Gradual Distribution**
   - Start with small user groups
   - As more people use it safely, antivirus engines learn it's safe

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Why Antivirus Might Flag It
- **Unsigned executable**: No code signing certificate
- **Electron overlay**: Similar patterns to some malware
- **Global hotkeys**: Keylogging-like functionality
- **Always-on-top**: Overlay behavior

### Making It More Trusted
- Add code signing certificate (best solution)
- Create proper installer with metadata
- Submit to Microsoft for analysis
- Build reputation gradually
